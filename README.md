# PySpark Recommendation System with Cosine Similarity
This PySpark implementation demonstrates a recommendation system based on cosine similarity. It utilizes PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to calculate similarities between items or users and generate recommendations.

## Overview
The recommendation system uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between items or users in a dataset. It leverages PySpark to perform distributed computations and generate personalized recommendations for users based on their preferences or behavior.

## Features
* Cosine Similarity: Compute the similarity between items or users using the cosine similarity metric.
* Item-Item or User-User Recommendations: Generate recommendations for users based on similarities between items (item-item recommendation) or users (user-user recommendation).
* Distributed Computation: Utilize PySpark's distributed computation model to calculate cosine similarity across a distributed environment.
* Scalable and Parallel Processing: Leverage PySpark's parallel processing capabilities to handle large datasets efficiently.
## Prerequisites
* Python installed in your environment.
* Apache Spark and PySpark set up on your local machine or a cluster.
